                    <h2>Alan Turing</h2>
                    <p>Alan Turing was a pioneering mathematician, logician, and cryptanalyst. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Turing played a crucial role in the development of early computers and contributed significantly to the breaking of the German Enigma code during World War II, which was pivotal in the Allied victory.</p>
                    <p>Turing's work laid the foundation for modern computing and his contributions to the field of computer science have inspired countless individuals. Despite his tragic personal life and untimely death, Turing's legacy continues to influence the world of technology and beyond.</p>
